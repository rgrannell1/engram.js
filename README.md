# Engram

## NOTE

This project has been discontinued; it takes far too much effort for one person to build a secure, fast tested bookmark server, and Pocket's mobile app is much nicer than their web interface which remove a lot of my incentive for trying.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/rgrannell1/engram.js.git
cd engram.js

make bstart
```
